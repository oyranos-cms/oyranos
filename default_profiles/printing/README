Included are profiles created by Kai-Uwe Behrmann <www.behrmann.name>.

The profiling software can be identified from the profiles.

To recreate a profile, you need a profiler installed and the according
characterisation data. The later should be included in each printing 
profile, and is as well provided in the “target” directory.

The targets where modified to satisfy ArgyllCMS' profiler.
The original characterisation data can be downloaded from the respective 
web sites.
