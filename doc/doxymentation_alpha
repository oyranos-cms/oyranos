    @section intro Introduction
  
    Oyranos is intended as a entry point for color savy applications.
    In its current stage it configures profile paths, sets default profiles, 
    maps devices to profiles, sets a monitor profile in X and uploads a vcgt
    tag. This means for instance all applications using Oyranos will use for
    a incoming digital camera picture the same profile and watch it through the
    same monitor profile with the same options for rendering intent, simulation
    and so on.

    @section tools User Tools Documentation
    - oyranos-monitor - a commandline tool for calling from a setup script like
      .xinitrc. It selects a profile for the current monitor and sets up the
      X server at startup time. Usage:
    @verbatim
    # select a monitor profile, load the binary blob into X and fill the
    # VideoCardGammaTable, if appropriate
    oyranos-monitor
    @endverbatim
    - oyranos-policy - a tool to set a policy from a xml file. Use it like:
    @verbatim
    oyranos-policy `oyranos-config --syscolordir`/`oyranos-config --settingsdirname`/office.policy.xml
    @endverbatim
    Affected are default profiles and some behaviour settings.
    - <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Oyranos_Configuration_Dialog">oyranos-config-fltk</a> - a configuration UI application, using some functions      of the Oyranos APIs. If you have <a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=ICC_Examin">ICC Examin</a> installed it can be called to
      show details of profiles. 
    - oyranos-config - a command line tool to get compiler flags to using Oyranos in your own project. Try  \a oyranos-config \a --help to see the appropriate options.

    @section user User API Documentation
    The basic Oyranos API gets included with oyranos.h. An application, which
    wants to use these functions, needs to link against Oyranos and Elektra.
    - @ref policy - load / save of user policies
    - @ref options - layout and describe options to the user; part of user policies
    - @ref behaviour - get and set common behaviour; part of user policies
    - @ref default_profiles - get and set commonly used profiles; part of user policies
    - @ref profile_lists - provides the search path content as profile lists for your GUI
    - @ref profile_handling - file I/O and more

    The monitor related API is contained in oyranos_monitor.h. Linking against
    the X11 libraries on Linux is done on runtime.
    - @ref monitor_api - monitor profile configuration

    The key names, which Oyranos uses to store its configuration in an Elektra
    file tree, are defined in oyranos_definitions.h.
    \n

    More in depth topics about programming with Oyranos can be found on the
    @ref coding page. 

    @subsection api_tutorial Programming Tutorial
    Frist you have to put a
    @verbatim
    #include <oyranos.h> @endverbatim
    in your source text, in order to use Oyranos. 
    @verbatim
    int oyranos_version = oyVersion(); @endverbatim
    \b oyranos-config \b --cflags delivers the compiler flags and \b oyranos-config \b --ldflags the linker flags.

    Then you can put Oyranos functions in your code and compile with:
    @verbatim
    cc `oyranos-config --cflags` `oyranos-config --ldflags` mycode.c -o myApp @endverbatim
    to link Oyranos into your application.

    The namespace in C++ is oyranos:: , e.g. oyranos::oyVersion().

    Writing of filters and modules for Oyranos is covered in the @ref
    extending_oyranos page.

/** @page coding Coding Conventions

    @section general_c_conventions General
    Oyranos is written in C for portability. All types belonging to its API's
    are prefixed with a \b oy.\n
    Oyranos objects naming is build after C++ conventions,
    where access to a class member is prefixed with the scope operator. \n
    \a oyranos::oyClass::oyClassFunction \n
    looks in Oyranos \n
    \a oyClass_Function. Of course a function specific to a data object 
    needs the object itself as argument, as the this pointer is not available. \n
    Oyranos features a flexible memory management and allows easy integration
    with different memory management strategies.

    @section data_handling Data Handling
    <p>Oyranos uses a mix of different structures. Among them are the basic C
    types, simple C structs and Oyranos managed structs.
    The structs are transparent for compile time typechecking and easy
    debugging at runtime.</p>

    <p>Objects are transparent to allow easier debugging. But be aware to not
    change the private members of Oyranos objects directly. 
    They are marked at end with a underscore \b _. Use the appropriate 
    functions for each object instead. Otherwise the objects are in danger to
    be handled inadequately.
    </p>

    @section memory_handling Memory Handling
    - For strings, constant pointers to chars are provided whenever possible.
    - For the need of allocating unknown sizes of memory, a function is passed
      by the user doing the memory allocation. The returned memory is then to
      be managed by the user.
    - More complex library allocated memory blocks, like profile name lists,
      can be freed with a Oyranos provided function. They should be encapsulated
      into a Oyranos object.
    - Oyranos objects transport always a allocator. The allocator is possible 
      to set by the user at Object creation time.
    - Objects can contain a user specified deallocator.

    @section  naming_convention Naming Conventions
    Declaration types are distinguishable through the below described naming
    conventions. \n
    A \b oy prefix is common for all functions, types and enums to
    display a namespace in C. \n
    \b Functions words are starting upper case, (after the oy prefix)
    oyVersion() \n
    \b Enums have all letters  written upper case. Words are separated by
                      underscore
      ::oyPROFILE_e \n
    \b Variables are written lower case and words are separated by underscore.
      ::oy_domain_codeset \n
    \b Macros are upper case and start with \b OY_ or \b oy:
      ::OY_HAVE_PNG \n
    As one exception some macros are normal named to allow later typing:
      ::oyChar \n
      Function alike macros are named like normal functions followed by
      a \b _m:
      oyColorOffset_m() \n
      For enum alike macros it is more appropriate to omit the _M suffix:
      ::OY_TYPE_123A_8 \n
    \b Stucts words start upper case followed by a \b _s:
      oyProfile_s \n
    \b Struct/object \b handling \b functions start upper case with the struct
    name, followed with the verb:
      oyProfile_GetChannelName() \n

    @subsection  suffixes  Declaration Overview
    - \b _t types, e.g. ::oyPixel_t
    - \b _s structs, e.g. oyProfileTag_s
    - \b _f functions, e.g. oyAlloc_f()
    - \b _e enums, e.g. ::oyCONNECTOR_EVENT_e
    - \b _u unions, e.g. ::oyValue_u
    - \b _M or \b _m or none for macro functions, e.g. oyToChannels_m(), ::OY_TYPE_123A_HALF
    - ending underscore \b _ for non editable internals, e.g. oyRegion_s::type_


    @section development Development Conventions

    @subsection api_design API Design
    Oyranos API's handle various tasks. A important idea is to make color 
    management easy. Thus some API's are high level and only a few calls
    are needed to do the, hopefully, right thing. For finer control
    many low level API's are exposed.\n
    It is as well possible to reimplement the Oyranos functionality. Some
    recommendations or standards are therefore provided at OpenICC. Feel free
    to contact the Oyranos project to discuss further details.\n
    Internal API's handle low level file access, internal static lists and
    adapt to modules.

    @subsection object_design Object Design
    Almost all Oyranos structs are based on the same structure ::oyStruct_s.
    They share first a member called \a type_ to better distinguish their type.
    The according value is available as a enum from
    ::oyOBJECT_e. \n
    Each object should implement a appropriate oyStruct_Copy_f() and a 
    oyStruct_Release_f() function member on position 2 and 3. 
    These allow to easily cast to the same type of functions of other objects.
    Many object manipulators in Oyranos rely on this feature.
    Thus each object can implement list functionality with a common base in the
    above mentioned ::oyStructList_s. The resoning behind the above outlined use
    of a common struct base and API's is, even with C casting, these help in
    reducing code size, at easier maintaining and in fixing bugs. \n
    The fourth member of a ::oyObject_s style struct is \a oy_ and features
    common properties, like memory management, naming and more. \n
    A new simple Oyranos data data structure should contain the type_ specifier
    and the two members of type oyStruct_Copy_f() and oyStruct_Release_f().
    Complex data structures should contain the type_ and oy_ structure to allow
    the advanced features. Otherwise the fourth member shall keep a intptr_t. \n
    Providing of similiar functions for different Oyranos objects, allows
    their use in a abstract way. A soft typecheck is possible over the type_ 
    member. For an example see the internal ::oyStructList_s struct with the 
    according C API. As casting in C is always blind, it is better to avoid, 
    except you know what you do.

    @subsection api_naming API Naming
    Keeping API members in a lexical relation allowes
    for later easy searching with tools of choice. So you find rather a 
    \a getOyNamedColorName but \a oyNamedColor_GetName and can easily find the
    related functions in the appropriate NamedColor API. The sheme follows
    C++ syntax: (namespace)\b oy(ranos)::(class)\b NamedColor::(function)
    \b getName.
    This should as well help in designing OO wrappers to allow consistency among
    C Oyranos and its wrappers for various languages.

/** @page extending_oyranos Extending Oyranos

    @section oyranos_modules_writing Oyranos modules writing

    Note that the object style APIs defined in oyranos_alpha.h are still subject
    to changes.

    @subsection write_modules Writing C Modules for Oyranos
    Oyranos modules can be filters, plug-ins, backends, CMMs or meta modules.
    The API design can be seen in the @ref module_api page. To start with a 
    module use the example code from the
    examples/dummy_filter/oyranos_cmm_dFil.c file.
    Change the header, e.g. "My name" string. Select a four byte identifier for
    the new module and define it in CMM_NICK. The comment above CMM_NICK
    describes how the module library and the xxxx_cmm_module data structure 
    (vtable) interact. Oyranos will search the appropriate
    path for libraries and will try to dlopen the xxxx_cmm_module data 
    structure. It therefore parses the library file name and takes the four 
    bytes before "_cmm_module" as the modules identifier. The "xxxx_cmm_module"
    symbol will be searched and if found the information form there will be used
    to access the module functions and data. \n
    \n
    If you choose your four byte identifier, substitute every occurence of
    "dFil" with the new identifier. \n
    \n
    In the OY_DUMMY_FILTER_REGISTRATION macro the "my_filter" name should be
    changed to something appropriate for the new module. Oyranos users will use
    primarily this name to select the module. A description on how a module 
    registration string is to be build and how it works can be found at the end
    of the Detailed Description section on @ref module_api. All occurences
    of "my_filter" in the file should be substituted accordingly. \n
    \n
    The old function dFilGetText should be adapted to provide the new 
    appropriate names, copyrights and a help texts on how to use the module.
    Go through all functions and adapt them to the filter needs. The
    dFilFilterPlug_MyFilterRun function is the core of the module. It contains
    the processing part or algorythm. Typically a filter contains two
    connectors, a plug and a socket. The connectors describe their capabilities
    and according to this Oyranos can check in advance if two filters fit each
    to the other. \n
    \n
    The oyCMMapi4_s holds most static informations of the module. It can be used
    to provide a processing context. A context is use in case it is very 
    expensive to compute such a context like in ICC CMMs for color conversions
    and the context shall be chached by Oyranos. The oyCMMapi7_s holds the 
    dFilFilterPlug_MyFilterRun function and the plugs and sockets. \n
    \n
    Compile and install the module library to see if Oyranos detects it 
    correctly. Use the test2 application therefore. It is in the source tree
    compiled through the "make check" shell command. The shell command to run is
    "test2 'CMMS list'". The test run will list all detected meta modules and
    the modules loaded by a meta module. The filters are sorted by their 
    provided APIs. The test2 command might be substituted by a dedicated module
    utility in the future.

    @subsection write_device_modules Writing Device Modules for Oyranos
    To start with a module use the examples/dummy_device/oyranos_cmm_dDev.c 
    file and modify it. Please follow the @ref write_modules subsection.
    The parts which differ are that instead of oyCMMapi4_s the oyCMMapi8_s
    will be implemented. The dDevConfigs_FromPattern 
    (oyCMMapi8_s::oyConfigs_FromPattern) is a function to
    call into the device module and create new oyConfig_s object(s).
    The dDevConfigs_Modify (oyCMMapi8_s::oyConfigs_Modify) function can use the
    same protocol with the difference, that it works on existing oyConfig_s 
    object(s). The "device_name" option should be ignored by dDevConfigs_Modify.
    The dDev_rank_map (oyCMMapi8_s::rank_map) tells how each option shall
    be wighted by Oyranos to select a profile from the Oyranos DB independent 
    from the device module. The calls into dDevConfigs_FromPattern and
    oyConfigs_Modify are string based. The option "command" will contain the 
    command name the device module shall act upon. \n
    \n
    The oyCMMapi8_s::registration string needs in its oyFILTER_REG_APPLICATION
    section a starting "config.device.icc_profile." followed by the
    device class name and separated by point '.' the the module nick. This
    convention shall enshure a proper mechanism is available to select the
    desired config domains from several ones. \n
    \n
    All "dDev" occurences in the source code need to be substituted by the 
    modules own four byte identifier. \n
    \n
    To test the device module use oyDeviceAskProfile(), oyDeviceGetInfo() and
    oyDeviceGet():
    @verbatim
    #include <oyranos_alpha.h>

    /* ... */

    oyConfig_s * device = 0; /* initialise with zero to avoid errors */
    oyProfile_s * profile = 0;
    oyOptions_s * options = 0;  /* not used in this example */
    char * text = 0;

    /* Call into the device modules oyCMMapi8_s::oyConfigs_FromPattern
     * function with the "list" command.
     * "monitor" is to be exchanged by the actual device class and
     * ":0.0" by the actual device nick name.
     */
    int error = oyDeviceGet( 0, "monitor", ":0.0", options, &device );

    /* obtain a expensive list of key/value pairs from the device module */
    error = oyDeviceGetInfo( device, oyNAME_DESCRIPTION, 0, &text,
                                     malloc );

    /* assign a profile to the device/driver */
    error = oyDeviceSetProfile( device, "some_real_profile_in_your_path.icc" );

    /* Ask Oyranos to lookup its DB for a matching profile. It is only useful
     * if a profile is already set for the devices keys. The set devices can be
     * viewed at the command line with:
     * ls -d ~/.kdb/user/org/freedesktop/imaging/config.device.icc_profile.*
     */
    error = oyDeviceAskProfile( device, &profile );
    @endverbatim
    It is useful to step through the code. Oyranos provides the --enable-debug
    configure option to aid debugging and stepping through. To build the module
    add the -g compiler option.

    The protocal on how the modules communicate with the core and the front end
    is described in the @ref device_protocol_1.

<a name="Implementation_Overview"></a><h4> Implementation Overview </h4>
<p>Oyranos implements <b>devices</b> as <i>oyConfig_s</i> objects.

</p>
<a name="Tables"></a><h4> Tables </h4>

<p>Options marked with "in:" are passed through a oyOptions_s argument to the module.

<p>Calling a device module without any command or a unknown command shall issue 
a message through the modules local oyMessage_f. The message shall contain 
infos about, describing calls and their properties and the expected results.
Otherwise adhering to the above protocol will enshure a base level of 
interoperability with users like KM.

<a name="How_to_create_a_useful_.22device_name.22_.28ID.29.3F"></a><h4> How to create a useful "device_name" (ID)? </h4>

<p>it should be unique in that the module can distinguish each device and
understand to build a device context. This is important for the case when no 
device context pointer/handle is passed from the user. How that is defined
is up to the module writer. Even though, a string, one which makes sense in
KM, would be much appreciated. e.g. in oyX1 it is "device_name"=":0.1" or
"device_name"="far-away.org:10.0". The modules XOpenDisplay() can directly use 
these strings and the module can create a context and talk to the device.
For SANE you have choosen "pnm:0", "pnm:1" and here locally I see
"plustek:libusb:003:002". The last is unfortunedly subject to change with a
new usb port or after newly plugging in. But that seems accepable.

<a name="Handling_device_contexts"></a><h4> Handling device contexts </h4>
<p>The "device_context" option can be set from the module during the "list" 
call into a device. The user can then see, which specific information is 
accepted by the module.
The module has implicitely to assume, that the user has no background about
the called device class, and to initialise a device by its own.
In case the user has already a context and passes 
this one to Oyranos, the module needs to extract the color related device 
settings from this and pass the device settings as string to Oyranos.
Oyranos will then be able to search for a according ICC profile.
</p><p>It is important for Oyranos, the module and the user to agree who is 
responsible for the driver contexts. oyOption_SetFromData() is useful to pass
a pointer through a oyOption_s. The size argument can be set to zero to avoid
freeing the pointer through Oyranos. In case the module provides a
context, e.g. in "list" then that needs to be released through driver functions.
Oyranos has the oyCMMptr_s struct defined in oyranos_cmm.h which can be used:

</p>

<a name="Multiple_Configurations_per_.22device_name.22"></a><h4> Multiple Configurations per "device_name" </h4>
<p>For backends its possible to resolve one "device_name" option to multiple 
driver configurations. Such backends are best implemented in that they 
resolve the oyConfig_s objects right from the beginning, e.g. the "list" 
call. Otherwise the oyConfig_s devices are not uniquely
defined. On a practical example, a CUPS device would be uniquely defined, 
if all color related and to be included PPD entries are included in the 
oyConfig_s::backend_core options as strings.
</p><p>Users can subsummarise such devices in that they look at the 
registration, manufacturer, model and serial number strings. However they 
should make clear that each device consists as well of the driver settings.
