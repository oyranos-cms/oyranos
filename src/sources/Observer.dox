/** @struct   oyObserver_s

 *  @extends oyStruct_s
 *  @brief    Oyranos object observers
 *
 *  oyObserver_s is following the viewer/model design pattern. The relations of
 *  oyObserver_s' can be anything up to complicated cyclic, directed graphs.
 *  The oyObserver_s type is intented for communication to non graph objects.
 *  Oyranos graphs have several communication paths available, which should
 *  be prefered over oyObserver_s when possible.
 *
 *  The struct contains properties to signal changes to a observer.
 *  The signaling provides a small set of very generic signals types as
 *  enumeration.
 *  It is possible for models to add additional data to the signal. These
 *  additional data is only blindly transported. A agreement is not subject of
 *  the oyObserver_s structure. For completeness the observed object shall
 *  always be included in the signal.
 *
 *  @version Oyranos: 0.9.7
 *  @date    2019/10/19
 *  @since   2009/10/26 (Oyranos: 0.1.10)
